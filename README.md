# Overview

In this project, we worked to combine a few different modules in order to have a more complete program. We worked to use react native, JavaScript, and Firebase. Using these tools, we made a fitness tracker application. One of the features is that it can use the built in sensor of the phone in order to track the steps that someone takes. It can also plan future workouts, log past ones, and it can tell you how many calories you should eat based on your personal stats (i.e. weight, height)

We wrote this software because we knew that physical fitness is something crucial, and for most people it is something that is pushed aside. We also knew that most fitness apps out there cost money in order to use. We decided to make our own, with the hopes of deepening our understanding of how to connect Firebase to an app using Javascript.

# Development Environment

Tools used:
- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Expo
- React Native Debugger
- Git
Programming Language and Libraries Used:
- JavaScript: The primary language used for developing the application.
- React Native: Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.
- Expo: A framework and platform for universal React applications.
- @react-native-community/datetimepicker: Library for implementing date and time pickers in the app.
- React Hooks: Used for managing state and lifecycle methods in functional components.
- Firebase- Used to create the database for the app
- React Native StyleSheet: Styles components in the app

# Future Work

- We want to add more features from the tracking of the phone. There are many things in the health app and that are tracked by the phone that we could add to the fitness app, for example time standing. 
- We would like to add suggested workouts, so creating a library of workouts that the user could choose to fit their specific needs. 
- We would like to improve the visual aspect of the application to make it look better. We can add things like different fonts, images, and backgrounds.
